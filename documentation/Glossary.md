* **User**: anyone who uses **The Undermine Bot**.
* **Bot**: a telegram bot.
* **WoW**: World of Warcraft Retail.
* **Game region**: Battle.net employs several region-based concepts to manage and deliver game data. Global regions: **EU, US, KR, TW**
* **Game server *a.k.a. realm*** : each game region has a bunch of servers grouped by locale. Name of these servers may be same for different regions. Ex. **Argent Dawn (EU)** and **Argent Dawn (US)**.
* **Auction house *a.k.a. market***: each server has it's own auction house. So auction house data depends on game region and game server.
* **Wow Token**: WoW Tokens are items that can be purchased by players for real money and then sold to other players for gold (World of Warcraft's in-game currency).
* **Custom keyboards**: whenever bot sends a message, it can pass along a special keyboard with predefined reply options (see [ReplyKeyboardMarkup](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#replykeyboardmarkup)). Telegram apps that receive the message will display your keyboard to the user. Tapping any of the buttons will immediately send the respective command. This way you can drastically simplify user interaction with your bot.
